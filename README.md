# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game – Python Console App

## 📌 Project Description

This is a **console-based Rock Paper Scissors game** developed in **Python**. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects its move. The game instantly displays the result (Win, Lose, or Tie) and continues in a loop until the user chooses to exit. It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project to practice Python fundamentals.

## ⚙️ Features

* Player vs Computer gameplay
* Random computer move generation
* Instant result display (Win / Lose / Tie)
* Input validation for correct choices ([R]ock, [P]aper, [S]cissors, [E]xit)
* Continuous gameplay until exit
* Simple and interactive console interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

* Python 3
* `random` module for computer move generation
* `re` module for input validation
* `os` module (optional, if used for clearing console)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Loops (continuous gameplay)
* Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
* Functions (can be added for modularity)
* Random choice selection
* String handling and comparison
* Input validation with regular expressions

## ▶️ How the Game Works

1. The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one option.
3. Both choices are compared using standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
4. The game displays whether the player wins, loses, or ties.
5. The loop repeats until the player chooses to exit.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add score tracking and rounds
* Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Include sound effects and animations
* Expand the game with additional options (e.g., Lizard, Spock)

## ✅ Learning Outcome

This project helps beginners understand:

* Building interactive Python programs
* Using loops and conditional logic for decision making
* Random number generation and handling user input
* Structuring a console-based game with clear logic
